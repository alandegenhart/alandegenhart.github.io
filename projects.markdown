## Research

### Constraints on the dynamics of neural population activity

Though chiefly envisioned as a tool for the restoration of function following paralysis, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can serve as a powerful tool for scientific discovery.  My current research focuses on using BCIs to probe the dynamics of neural population activity in motor cortex.  This will allow us to better understand how the cortex carries out the computations required to guide complex behavior.

### A stabilized brain-computer interface based on neural manifold alignment

Recent demonstrations have provided compelling evidence of the ability of BCIs to provide functional restoration for individuals with paralysis.  However, a major barrier to the clinical adoption of BCI systems are neural recording instabilities, which can quickly lead to degradations in device performance.  To overcome this shortcoming, I, in collaboration with colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, have developed a stabilized BCI which utilizes the structure in neural population activity to improve BCI stability.

### Three-dimensional BCI control by individuals with upper-limb paralysis using electrocorticography

Electrocorticography (ECoG) has gained prominence as a potential source of control signals for BCIs, owing in part to its stability, relatively high spatial and temporal resolution (as compared to EEG), and minimal signal processing requirements.  As a graduate student, I assessed the ability of individuals with upper-limb paralysis to control a three-dimensional ECoG-based BCI.  As part of this work, I developed a BCI software suite capable of controlling various effectors (e.g., computer cursors, prosthetic limbs) using control signals extracted from ECoG recordings in real-time.
