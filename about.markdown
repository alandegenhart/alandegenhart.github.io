I currently live in Seattle, Washington with my wife and two dogs.  Outside of work I am an avid mountain biker, and enjoy spending as much time as possible in the outdoors.  I am also passionate about music and music technology -- I enjoy playing music (primarily guitar), dabbling with home recording, buliding guitar amplifiers, and from 2014 to 2020 I was co-instructor for the [Music Engineering Lab at the University of Pittsburgh](http://www.vialab.org/MEL/).  I also maintain and manage the web presence for [Volcano Guitar Works](https://www.volcanoguitarworks.com), a small musical instrument supply company founded in 1983 by my parents.
