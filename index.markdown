Note: I am currently looking for full-time Research Scientist, Data Scientist, or Machine Learning Engineer positions.

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Carnegie Mellon University currently co-mentored by Byron Yu (Carnegie Mellon University) and Aaron Batista (University of Pittsburgh). My current research involves the the investigation of neural computation, dynamics, motor control, and learning using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). As a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh, I investigated the ability of individuals with upper-limb paralysis to control an electrocorticography-based brain-computer interface.
