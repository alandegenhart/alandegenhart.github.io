I'm happy to announce that I've started a new position at the [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://alleninstitute.org).  As a Scientist in the MindScope Program, I'll be using computational techniques to investigate coding properties of neural populations in the visual system.  I'm looking forward to be a part of the Institute's vision of conducting large-scale, multidisciplinary neuroscience research.

Some recent examples of work coming out of the Allen Institute:
- [A large-scale standardized physiological survey reveals functional organization of the mouse visual cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0550-9)
- [Survey of spiking in the mouse visual system reveals functional hierarchy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03171-x)
- [Shared and distinct transcriptomic cell types across neocortical areas](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0654-5)
